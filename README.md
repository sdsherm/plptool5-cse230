# plptool5-cse230
Some projects from my Assembly / Computer Org class, completed using PLPTool 5.2.

Project 1 - Demonstration of a simple loop using jump to command
Project 2 - Demonstration of the implementation of simple loops, other basic commands to produce flashing light patterns
            on the LED Array using the switches
Project 3 - Use of the UART console to input strings; a program to check whether or not a string is a palindrome.
            The strings must be separated by a '.'
Project 4 - Demonstration of an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) which periodically interupts the sseg display to flash the LEDs,
            either on or off, every 140 cycles.
